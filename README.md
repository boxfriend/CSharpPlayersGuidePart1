###### [Solutions to Part 2: Object-Oriented Programming](https://github.com/boxfriend/CSharpPlayersGuidePart2)

I am not new to C# (at least not relative to the audience the book was intended for). But I figured I would go through it to make sure there are no gaps in my knowledge and to learn about some of the changes introduced in C# 10. Below you will find links to each challenge with a short description of the challenge. There are a couple challenges that have been grouped together because the subsequent challenges modify code from previous ones

[Hello World!](CSharpPlayersGuide/Program.cs) - Self explanatory, just make the console print "Hello World!".

[What Comes Next](WhatComesNext/Program.cs) - Change Hello World to say anything else (left this one separate to keep my Hello World intact)

[The Makings Of A Programmer](TheMakingsOfAProgrammer/Program.cs) - Write a program with 5 Console.WriteLine in it

[Consolas and Telim](ConsolasAndTelim/Program.cs) - Get input from the user and display it

[The Thing Namer 3000](TheThingRenamer3k/Program.cs) - Add comments and fix a typo in a program provided by the book

[The Variable Shop & The Variable Shop Returns](TheVariableShop/Program.cs) - Display all 14 primitive types & Change the variable values and display the new value.

[The Triangle Farmer](TheTriangleFarmer/Program.cs) - Write a program to input the width and height of a triangle and calculate its area

[The Four Sisters and the Duckbear](TheFourSistersAndTheDuckbear/Program.cs) - Write a program to divide an integer and get its remainder using the `%` operator

[The Dominion of Kings](TheDominionOfKings/Program.cs) - Get input from the user and calculate then display number of points based on the provided input.

[The Defense of Consolas](TheDefenseOfConsolas/Program.cs) - Change the console window title and get input representing a point from the user and calculate neighboring point positions

[Repairing the Clocktower](RepairingTheClocktower/Program.cs) - Get integer input from the user and determine if the input is even or odd

[Watchtower](Watchtower/Program.cs) - Convert X and Y value to string representing cardinal directions

[Buying Inventory & Discounted Inventory](BuyingInventory/Program.cs) - Display a menu of available items, get input from user to select an item and display its price & Ask for a name for input and provide discount if the name is correct

[The Prototype](ThePrototype/Program.cs) - Get a number from first user then get number from second user displaying whether it is equal to, higher than, or lower than first number

[TheMagicCannon](TheMagicCannon/Program.cs) - Loop through 1 - 100 and determine if multiple of 3, 5, both, or neither. Change color and output based on multiple

[The Replicator of D'To](TheReplicatorOfDTo/Program.cs) - Create an array, copy the array using a loop and display both arrays

[The Laws of Freach](TheLawsOfFreach/Program.cs) - Modified provided code that uses `for` loop to use `foreach`

[Taking a Number](TakingANumber/Program.cs) - Write a method that displays text to the console and asks for an int and display it. Then another method that asks for a number in a specific range and only display it if within range

[Countdown](Countdown/Program.cs) - Use a recursive method to countdown from 10 to 1

[Hunting the Manticore](HuntingTheManticore/Program.cs) - Get input from user, display current state to the console, determine whether further input is equal to, higher than, or lower than initial input, determine if round is multiple of 3, 5, both, or none, modify variables based on these results. This is effectively a combination of all knowledge gained so far

## Other notes:
Normally I would use Rider since I have a license for it, however Visual Studio 2022 was used for these challenges because that is what the book recommends and I also wanted to check out its new features. These challenges are obviously pretty simple for someone with experience in C#, however I felt going through them anyway would be a good experience as I went through the book, this also solidifies my completion of the book whenever I get there. Can't 100% it if I skip the easy stuff for being too easy.

You may also notice some things are part of the same commits even though they should have been separate. This is because I keep forgetting to commit because I've been super focused on actually reading the book materials. Also I've never been good at remembering to commit for anything that isn't a shared project.
